          |                                                                      |   0%

        | In this lesson, we will explore some basic building blocks of the R
        | programming language.

        ...

          |==                                                                    |   3%
        | If at any point you'd like more information on a particular topic related to
        | R, you can type help.start() at the prompt, which will open a menu of
        | resources (either within RStudio or your default web browser, depending on
        | your setup). Alternatively, a simple web search often yields the answer
        | you're looking for.

        ...

          |====                                                                  |   5%
        | In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type 5 + 7
        | and press Enter.

        >
        > 5 + 7
        [1] 12

        | You are really on a roll!

          |======                                                                |   8%
        | R simply prints the result of 12 by default. However, R is a programming
        | language and often the reason we use a programming language as opposed to a
        | calculator is to automate some process or avoid unnecessary repetition.

        ...

          |=======                                                               |  11%
        | In this case, we may want to use our result from above in a second
        | calculation. Instead of retyping 5 + 7 every time we need it, we can just
        | create a new variable that stores the result.

        ...

          |=========                                                             |  13%
        | The way you assign a value to a variable in R is by using the assignment
        | operator, which is just a 'less than' symbol followed by a 'minus' sign. It
        | looks like this: <-

        ...

          |===========                                                           |  16%
        | Think of the assignment operator as an arrow. You are assigning the value on
        | the right side of the arrow to the variable name on the left side of the
        | arrow.

        ...

          |=============                                                         |  18%
        | To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x <- 5 +
        | 7. This can be read as 'x gets 5 plus 7'. Give it a try now.

        > x <- 5+7

        | All that hard work is paying off!

          |===============                                                       |  21%
        | You'll notice that R did not print the result of 12 this time. When you use
        | the assignment operator, R assumes that you don't want to see the result
        | immediately, but rather that you intend to use the result for something else
        | later on.

        ...

          |=================                                                     |  24%
        | To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try it
        | now.

        >
        > 
        > x
        [1] 12

        | Excellent work!

          |==================                                                    |  26%
        | Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

        >
        > x - 3
        [1] 9

        | Not quite! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

        | Type y <- x - 3 and press Enter. Whether you use x - 3 or x-3 is personal
        | preference, but it's good habit to include a space on either side of the
        | assignment operator.

        > y <- x -3

        | Great job!

          |====================                                                  |  29%
        | What is the value of y? Type y to find out.

        > y
        [1] 9

        | Keep up the great work!

          |======================                                                |  32%
        | Now, let's create a small collection of numbers called a vector. Any object
        | that contains data is called a data structure and numeric vectors are the
        | simplest type of data structure in R. In fact, even a single number is
        | considered a vector of length one.

        ...

          |========================                                              |  34%
        | The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which stands for
        | 'concatenate' or 'combine'. To create a vector containing the numbers 1.1, 9,
        | and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the result in a variable
        | called z.

        >
        > z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)

        | Nice work!

          |==========================                                            |  37%
        | Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R's
        | built-in help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want more
        | information on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses that
        | normally follow a function name. Give it a try.

        > ?c
        Browsing http://127.0.0.1:25288/library/base/html/c.html

        | Keep up the great work!

          |============================                                          |  39%
        | Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the
        | values in the output.

        > z
        [1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

        | Nice work!

          |=============================                                         |  42%
        | You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that
        | contains z, 555, then z again in that order. Don't assign this vector to a
        | new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.

        > c(z, 555, z)
        [1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

        | Keep working like that and you'll get there!

          |===============================                                       |  45%
        | Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to
        | see what happens: z * 2 + 100.

        > z * 2 + 100
        [1] 102.20 118.00 106.28

        | That's a job well done!

          |=================================                                     |  47%
        | First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100
        | to each element to get the result you see above.

        ...

          |===================================                                   |  50%
        | Other common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^` (where x^2 means
        | 'x squared'). To take the square root, use the sqrt() function and to take
        | the absolute value, use the abs() function.

        ...

          |=====================================                                 |  53%
        | Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.

        > my_sqrt = sqrt(z - 1)

        | Not quite! Try again. Or, type info() for more options.

        | Assign the result of sqrt(z - 1) to a variable called my_sqrt.

        > my_sqrt <- sqrt(z - 1)

        | All that practice is paying off!

          |=======================================                               |  55%
        | Before we view the contents of the my_sqrt variable, what do you think it
        | contains?

        1: a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
        2: a vector of length 0 (i.e. an empty vector)
        3: a vector of length 3

        Selection: 3

        | Keep up the great work!

          |=========================================                             |  58%
        | Print the contents of my_sqrt.

        > my_sqrt
        [1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

        | You are doing so well!

          |==========================================                            |  61%
        | As you may have guessed, R first subtracted 1 from each element of z, then
        | took the square root of each element. This leaves you with a vector of the
        | same length as the original vector z.

        ...

          |============================================                          |  63%
        | Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z divided by
        | my_sqrt.

        >
        > my_div <- z / my_sqrt

        | All that practice is paying off!

          |==============================================                        |  66%
        | Which statement do you think is true?

        1: my_div is a single number (i.e a vector of length 1)
        2: my_div is undefined
        3: The first element of my_div is equal to the first element of z divided by the first element of my_sqrt, and so on...

        Selection: 3

        | That's a job well done!

          |================================================                      |  68%
        | Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

        > my_div
        [1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

        | You got it right!

          |==================================================                    |  71%
        | When given two vectors of the same length, R simply performs the specified
        | arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) element-by-element. If the vectors
        | are of different lengths, R 'recycles' the shorter vector until it is the
        | same length as the longer vector.

        ...

          |====================================================                  |  74%
        | When we did z * 2 + 100 in our earlier example, z was a vector of length 3,
        | but technically 2 and 100 are each vectors of length 1.

        ...

          |=====================================================                 |  76%
        | Behind the scenes, R is 'recycling' the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100
        | to make a vector of 100s. In other words, when you ask R to compute z * 2 +
        | 100, what it really computes is this: z * c(2, 2, 2) + c(100, 100, 100).

        ...

          |=======================================================               |  79%
        | To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try adding c(1,
        | 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don't worry about saving the result in a new variable.

        > c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
        [1]  1 12  3 14

        | Keep up the great work!

          |=========================================================             |  82%
        | If the length of the shorter vector does not divide evenly into the length of
        | the longer vector, R will still apply the 'recycling' method, but will throw
        | a warning to let you know something fishy might be going on.

        ...

          |===========================================================           |  84%
        | Try c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) for an example.

        > c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)
        [1]   1  12 103   4
        Warning message:
        In c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) :
          longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length

        | Keep working like that and you'll get there!

          |=============================================================         |  87%
        | Before concluding this lesson, I'd like to show you a couple of time-saving
        | tricks.

        ...

          |===============================================================       |  89%
        | Earlier in the lesson, you computed z * 2 + 100. Let's pretend that you made
        | a mistake and that you meant to add 1000 instead of 100. You could either
        | re-type the expression, or...

        ...

          |================================================================      |  92%
        | In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through previous
        | commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you get to this
        | command (z * 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit Enter. If the up arrow
        | doesn't work for you, just type the corrected command.

        > z * 2 + 1000                 
        [1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28

        | Keep up the great work!

          |==================================================================    |  95%
        | Finally, let's pretend you'd like to view the contents of a variable that you
        | created earlier, but you can't seem to remember if you named it my_div or
        | myDiv. You could try both and see what works, or...

        ...

          |====================================================================  |  97%
        | You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the Tab key
        | (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will provide a list
        | of variables that you've created that begin with 'my'. This is called
        | auto-completion and can be quite handy when you have many variables in your
        | workspace. Give it a try. (If auto-completion doesn't work for you, just type
        | my_div and press Enter.)

        > my_div
        [1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

        | That's a job well done!

2.  Прохождение курса Workspace and Files

          |                                                                      |   0%

        | In this lesson, you'll learn how to examine your local workspace in R and
        | begin to explore the relationship between your workspace and the file system
        | of your machine.

        ...

          |==                                                                    |   3%
        | Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards
        | to things like file paths, the outputs of these commands may vary across
        | machines.

        ...

          |====                                                                  |   5%
        | However it's important to note that R provides a common API (a common set of
        | commands) for interacting with files, that way your code will work across
        | different kinds of computers.

        ...

          |=====                                                                 |   8%
        | Let's jump right in so you can get a feel for how these special functions
        | work!

          |=======                                                               |  10%

        | That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20. We could also

        | The result is a vector of real numbers starting with pi (3.142...) and

        | However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate built-in

        | There are often several approaches to solving the same problem, particularly
        | in R. Simple approaches that involve less typing are generally best. It's
        | also important for your code to be readable, so that you and others can
        | figure out what's going on without too much hassle.

        ...

          |=======================================================               |  78%
        | If R has a built-in function for a particular task, it's likely that function
        | is highly optimized for that purpose and is your best option. As you become a
        | more advanced R programmer, you'll design your own functions to perform tasks
        | when there are no better options. We'll explore writing your own functions in

        | One more function related to creating sequences of numbers is rep(), which
        | stands for 'replicate'. Let's look at a few uses.

        ...

          |=============================================================         |  87%
        | If we're interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we can use
        | rep(0, times = 40). Try it out.

        >
        > rep(0, times = 40)
         [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        [39] 0 0

        | You got it!

          |================================================================      |  91%
        | If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector (0, 1,
        | 2), we can do rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10). Go ahead.

        > rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10)
         [1] 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2

        | You nailed it! Good job!

          |===================================================================   |  96%
        | Finally, let's say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2) over and
        | over again, we want our vector to contain 10 zeros, then 10 ones, then 10
        | twos. We can do this with the `each` argument. Try rep(c(0, 1, 2), each =
        | 10).

        > 
        > rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)

        | Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An atomic
        | vector contains exactly one data type, whereas a list may contain multiple
        | data types. We'll explore atomic vectors further before we get to lists.

        ...

          |====                                                                  |   5%
        | In previous lessons, we dealt entirely with numeric vectors, which are one
        | type of atomic vector. Other types of atomic vectors include logical,
        | character, integer, and complex. In this lesson, we'll take a closer look at
        | logical and character vectors.

        ...

          |======                                                                |   8%
        | Logical vectors can contain the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for 'not
        | available'). These values are generated as the result of logical
        | 'conditions'. Let's experiment with some simple conditions.

        ...

          |=======                                                               |  11%
        | First, create a numeric vector num_vect that contains the values 0.5, 55,
        | -10, and 6.

        >
        > num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)

        | Keep working like that and you'll get there!

        | Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect < 1, which
        | is read as 'num_vect is less than 1'.

        > num_vect < 1
        [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

        | You almost had it, but not quite. Try again. Or, type info() for more

        | You are amazing!

        | The first element of num_vect is 0.5, which is less than 1 and therefore the
        | statement 0.5 < 1 is TRUE. The second element of num_vect is 55, which is
        | greater than 1, so the statement 55 < 1 is FALSE. The same logic applies for
        | the third and fourth elements.

        ...

        | Tack your name on to the end of the my_char vector using the c() function.
        | Be sure to assign the result to a new variable called my_name. If your name
        | was "Swirl", you would type my_name <- c(my_char, "Swirl").

        > my_name <- c(my_char, "QazRT")

        | You are quite good my friend!

          |====================================================                  |  74%
        | Take a look at the contents of my_name.

        > my_name
        [1] "My"    "name"  "is"    "QazRT"

        | That's the answer I was looking for.

          |=====================================================                 |  76%
        | Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name together
        | into a single character string. Don't forget to say collapse = " "!

        > paste(my_name, collapse=" ")
        [1] "My name is QazRT"

        | Your dedication is inspiring!

          |=======================================================               |  79%
        | In this example, we used the paste() function to collapse the elements of a
        | single character vector. paste() can also be used to join the elements of
        | multiple character vectors.

        ...

          |=========================================================             |  82%
        | In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of
        | length 1 (i.e. join two words). Try paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " "),
        | where the `sep` argument tells R that we want to separate the joined elements
        | with a single space.

        > paste("Hello","world!", sep = " ")
        [1] "Hello world!"

        | You got it right!

          |===========================================================           |  84%
        | For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each of
        | length 3. Use paste() to join the integer vector 1:3 with the character
        | vector c("X", "Y", "Z"). This time, use sep = "" to leave no space between
        | the joined elements.

        > paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"))
        [1] "1 X" "2 Y" "3 Z"

        | That's not the answer I was looking for, but try again. Or, type info() for
        | more options.

        | Use paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "") to see what happens when we join
        | two vectors of equal length using paste().

        > paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "")
        [1] "1X" "2Y" "3Z"

        | You are amazing!

          |=============================================================         |  87%
        | What do you think will happen if our vectors are of different length? (Hint:
        | we talked about this in a previous lesson.)

        ...

          |===============================================================       |  89%
        | Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-"), where LETTERS is a
        | predefined variable in R containing a character vector of all 26 letters in
        | the English alphabet.

5.  Прохождение курса Missing Values

          |                                                                      |   0%

        | Missing values play an important role in statistics and data analysis. Often,
        | missing values must not be ignored, but rather they should be carefully
        | studied to see if there's an underlying pattern or cause for their
        | missingness.

        ...

          |====                                                                  |   5%
        | In R, NA is used to represent any value that is 'not available' or 'missing'
        | (in the statistical sense). In this lesson, we'll explore missing values
        | further.

        ...

          |=======                                                               |  10%
        | Any operation involving NA generally yields NA as the result. To illustrate,
        | let's create a vector c(44, NA, 5, NA) and assign it to a variable x.

        >
        > x <- c(44, NA, 5, NA)

        | Nice work!

          |===========                                                           |  15%
        | Now, let's multiply x by 3.

        > x * 3
        [1] 132  NA  15  NA

        | You are really on a roll!

          |==============                                                        |  20%
        | Notice that the elements of the resulting vector that correspond with the NA
        | values in x are also NA.

        ...

          |==================                                                    |  25%
        | To make things a little more interesting, lets create a vector containing
        | 1000 draws from a standard normal distribution with y <- rnorm(1000).

        >
        > y <- rnorm(1000)

        | You are doing so well!

          |=====================                                                 |  30%
        | Next, let's create a vector containing 1000 NAs with z <- rep(NA, 1000).

        > z <- rep(NA, 1000)

        | You got it right!

          |=========================                                             |  35%
        | Finally, let's select 100 elements at random from these 2000 values
        | (combining y and z) such that we don't know how many NAs we'll wind up with
        | or what positions they'll occupy in our final vector -- my_data <-
        | sample(c(y, z), 100).

        > my_data <- sample(c(y, z), 100)

        | You got it!

          |============================                                          |  40%
        | Let's first ask the question of where our NAs are located in our data. The
        | is.na() function tells us whether each element of a vector is NA. Call
        | is.na() on my_data and assign the result to my_na.

        > my_na <- is.na(my_data)

        | That's correct!

          |================================                                      |  45%
        | Now, print my_na to see what you came up with.

        > my_na
          [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE
         [13]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
         [25]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
         [37]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
         [49] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
         [61]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
         [73] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
         [85]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
         [97]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

        | You are quite good my friend!

          |===================================                                   |  50%
        | Everywhere you see a TRUE, you know the corresponding element of my_data is
        | NA. Likewise, everywhere you see a FALSE, you know the corresponding element
        | of my_data is one of our random draws from the standard normal distribution.

        ...

          |======================================                                |  55%
        | In our previous discussion of logical operators, we introduced the `==`
        | operator as a method of testing for equality between two objects. So, you
        | might think the expression my_data == NA yields the same results as is.na().
        | Give it a try.

        >      
        > my_data == NA
          [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
         [26] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
         [51] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
         [76] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

        | That's the answer I was looking for.

          |==========================================                            |  60%
        | The reason you got a vector of all NAs is that NA is not really a value, but
        | just a placeholder for a quantity that is not available. Therefore the
        | logical expression is incomplete and R has no choice but to return a vector
        | of the same length as my_data that contains all NAs.

        ...

          |==============================================                        |  65%
        | Don't worry if that's a little confusing. The key takeaway is to be cautious
        | when using logical expressions anytime NAs might creep in, since a single NA
        | value can derail the entire thing.

        ...

          |=================================================                     |  70%
        | So, back to the task at hand. Now that we have a vector, my_na, that has a
        | TRUE for every NA and FALSE for every numeric value, we can compute the total
        | number of NAs in our data.

        ...

          |====================================================                  |  75%
        | The trick is to recognize that underneath the surface, R represents TRUE as
        | the number 1 and FALSE as the number 0. Therefore, if we take the sum of a
        | bunch of TRUEs and FALSEs, we get the total number of TRUEs.

        ...

          |========================================================              |  80%
        | Let's give that a try here. Call the sum() function on my_na to count the
        | total number of TRUEs in my_na, and thus the total number of NAs in my_data.
        | Don't assign the result to a new variable.

        >
        > sum(my_na)
        [1] 48

        | You got it!

          |============================================================          |  85%
        | Pretty cool, huh? Finally, let's take a look at the data to convince
        | ourselves that everything 'adds up'. Print my_data to the console.
